# ADMM-NeuralNetworks
Training Neural Networks Without Gradients: A ADMM Approach (Matlab)

# This code was implemented follow below paper; however, I used Mean Square Error loss instead of Binary Hinge loss

# Only support for GPU?
I only implemented for GPU version and tested on MNIST data.

# How to run?
Run main.m
